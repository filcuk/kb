# Q&A
### When finding an average, why is sum used rather than a difference?
Intuitively, a difference would be what we need to get the middle point between two numbers.

An average of two numbers can be expressed in a generic formula: $a+(b−a)/2$
The same formula can be written as: $(2⋅a+b−a)/2=(a+b)/2$
Hence the shortcut of a sum.

# Q&A
## Averages
### When finding an average, why is sum used rather than a difference?
Intuitively, a difference would be what we need to get the middle point between two numbers.

An average of two numbers can be expressed in a generic formula: $a+(b−a)/2$
The same formula can be written as: $(2⋅a+b−a)/2=(a+b)/2$
Hence the shortcut of a sum.

### Why is an average of an average usually incorrect?
The average of ${2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2}$ is $2, (N=13)$ and the average of ${4}$ is $4, (N=1)$.
The average of the averages is $3$. But the average of all numbers is $30/14 ≃ 2.14$.

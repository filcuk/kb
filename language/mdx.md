# About
> MDX is an industry standard query and calculation language used to retrieve data from OLAP databases. In Analysis Services, MDX is the query language used to retrieve data, but also supports data definition and data manipulation. MDX editors are built into SQL Server Management Studio, Reporting Services, and SQL Server Data Tools. You can use the MDX editors to create ad hoc queries or reusable script if the data operation is repeatable.
> 
> Some tools and applications, such as Excel, use MDX constructs internally to query an Analysis Services data source. You can also use MDX programmatically, by enclosing MDX statement in an XMLA Execute request.
